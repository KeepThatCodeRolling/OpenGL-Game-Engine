# OpenGL-Game-Engine
The purpose of this project will be to create a Game engine that will be able to handle 2D games (PixelsArt Primarily).
I will be going through an OpenGL Tutorial in order to replicate a game like Breakout then I will modify the code to my liking.

This Game engine has a couple of dependencies that I will try to include so that the user will not have to go through the trouble of downloading the dependencies
